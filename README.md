# Offline Battleship Game

This is one of my school projects to test my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages.

# Gameplay
Place your ships on the grid by following the prompts.
Take turns with the AI to guess the locations of each other's ships.
Sink all enemy ships to win the game!

# Game Rules
The game is played on a 10x10 grid.
Each player has a fleet of ships of varying lengths.
Players take turns to guess the coordinates of the opponent's ships.
Your turn will continue until you miss.
The first player to sink all the opponent's ships wins.
The game ends when either the player or the computer sinks all the opponent's ships.

# Restarting the Game
You can restart the game during or after play by clicking the "Restart" button or by refreshing the page.

# Code Explanation
I have added comments in the code file to explain each part line by line.
Hope you enjoy testing it!
